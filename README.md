# Module 14 Challenge

## Overview of the Citi Bike

This project's main objective is use Pandas to change the "tripduration" column from an integer to a datetime datatype. Then, create a set of visualizations to:

- Show the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders
- Show the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week
- Show the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.
