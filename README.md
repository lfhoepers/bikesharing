# Module 14 Challenge

## Overview of the Citi Bike

This project's main objective is use Pandas to change the "tripduration" column from an integer to a datetime datatype. Then, create a set of visualizations to:

- Show the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders
- Show the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week
- Show the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.

**Adicional Visualization 1** The images above we can see that no have more than a half users are male and the most part are subscribers.

On the analyses above we can noticed that around 8 am and 5pm to 6pm are the most used times on weekdays and sadurday people usually use the services from 9am to 6pm.

**Adicional Visualization 2** The last analyses shows that downtown is the most used sharing bikes.



## Summary: 

In summary, it is clear that the highest level of customers are men and during business hours. My suggestion is to invest more to try to attract the other genres as much as possible. As well as weekend events to attract families, etc.

My first suggestion of Visualization is to see where the people are not using the services, like the image below.

My second suggestion is the monthly analysis to have better idea of seasonality, etc.


I appreciate the opportunity to present this project, I am available for any clarification.
